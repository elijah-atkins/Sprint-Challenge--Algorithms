#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) setting variable and running basic loop runs at constant time
Big O of N
O(n)


b) setting variable and running nested loops (n*n)
Big O of N Squared

c)simple recursion, running as basic loop runs at constant time
O(n)

## Exercise II

The strategy to minimize damaged eggs

Start from from lowest floor and drop an egg
if it doesn't break go up one floor and drop another egg
repeat until egg breaks and return floor f

This would be Big O of N because it runs a fixed number of operations per floor
